# Waikare Inlet

Most locals from Paihia and Russell don't know Waikare Inlet. Access is through a gravel road, only trampers and farmers go there. Once arrived at the border of the forest, I could follow an easy track, but I did not know where I was on my printed map. I crossed a river dozens of times, followed orange triangle and “electric cable” markers until the last one. Then what? Without navigation skills and tools and despite looking hours for the next step, my only way was to walk back to the well-marked section before dark, otherwise I would consider myself lost in the wild. I understood during that rainy day the challenge of walking out of the bitten track, even a famous one – part of Te Araroa. Back to town, I told about what happened, and I was ashamed. You're never proud of being lost or walking back.
