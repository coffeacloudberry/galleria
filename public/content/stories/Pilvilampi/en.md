# Pilvilampi

That was my first trip inland, circumnavigating one of the thousands lakes of Finland. Water was as still as a mountain tarn, mosquitoes were excited, me too. I started on a gravel road and finished off-track. A revival after the quarantine period and a quick introduction to the environment. I am discovering the Finnish culture at the meantime: Lordi, The Moomins, liquorice ice cream, comedy from ISMO and Ray Zambino, etc.
