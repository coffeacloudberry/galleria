# Corsica

We had a relaxing visit to Corsica, taking short walks through the city, mountains, forests, rivers, and on the beach. Finnish people are not used to so much heat and sunshine, so we got headaches. By the way, yes I consider myself more Finnish than French. The sea was warm enough to swim in, although we spotted some fascinating sea urchins. We also explored the local cuisine and culture. We stayed at a campsite for free in exchange for helping with farm work for half a day. The farm has vegies and bees. It was the orange and avocado season, but not yet tourist season. We visited less popular places. We spent more time in wilderness than in the city. One morning, on a walk through the rainy forest, we saw wild boars. A recent flood partially destroyed the track, but we found our way along the river and climbed up the hill to enjoy the panorama. On the way back, we opted to sail instead of taking the ferry. It's more sustainable, fun, and scenic. We saw many dolphins swimming around the boat, and a sea turtle. Take a [look at my video](https://lone.earth/w/8vjtaGgEQNj7YNgq5ACgbj). It was also nice meeting people who share the same love for nature.
