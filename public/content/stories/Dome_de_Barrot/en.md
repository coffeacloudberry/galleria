# Barrot Dome

Did you know how much tree hugging is relaxing? But {caterpillars}="lymantria dispar" like oak as well. The western side of this track had more wildlife, I spotted a deer on the path, and a zygaenidae butterfly on knautia arvensis. The eastern side was more scenic, and I finished the walk with a friendly tramper I met on top of DÃ´me de Barrot.
