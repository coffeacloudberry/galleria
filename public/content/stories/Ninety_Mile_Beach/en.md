# Ninety Mile Beach

On my way, I met a Māori who picked me up. “One time, we (Māoris) will kill a British. They steal our land, they keep green landscape for cows instead of houses – that doesn't help people with no home and there is shit everywhere. That is not Aotearoa anymore! Half of the British are good but the other half are bad. You are okay because you're French.” Fortunately, we had handshake, and I smiled despite listening to an extreme point of view. I wasn't feeling unsafe though because “we care for each other.”

In the meantime, my diet kept changing – from meat and fried fast food to cereal and rice – that was hard for my stomach, and I was feeling sick. The fast changing weather and temperature didn't help – indeed, spring in New Zealand is a bit wet. Anyway, I was on top of the island in two days and hiked the first 12.5 km to the Twilight Campground near the Ninety Mile Beach.

I met a girl in the campground. Sarah had the ambition of walking Te Araroa, which is thru-hiking the north and the south island in 2,998 km... in 3 months! That time, I wasn't the crazy one and that made me feel better. We walked together for three days, about 89 km to Ahipara, where the beach ends. The walk along the Ninety Mile Beach was pretty boring, all flat. Hopefully, not 90 miles long but 63. We pushed each other's motivation to keep walking and denied free lifts from drivers on the beach. The first steps of the walk, around the lighthouse was actually the best, with diverse landscape: beach, bush, and red ground after Te Werahi Stream.

I finished my intended modest walk but Sarah was mentally exhausted and her numerous blisters looked painful. The lack of preparation and resiliency may have broken her. Much worst happened to me later on.
