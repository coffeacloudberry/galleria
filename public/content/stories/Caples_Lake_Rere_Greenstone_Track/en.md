# Caples, Lake Rere, Greenstone Track

The Greenstone / Caples Track was a rest, an easy track for families and grandmas. I made a detour to Lake Rere â€“ perfect reflection early morning, broken symmetry later on, broken by innocent ducks. Whereas I found many Fantails and Tomtits on the Pyke / Hollyford Route, Riflemen and Robins dominated the Beech forest of the Caples and Greenstone valleys. I finished the tramp in two days instead of four as expected.
