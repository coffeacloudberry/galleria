# Kaweka

Hitching on a remote road is a test of patience. At 3pm, a guy said “you see this house? Go there if it’s late and can’t get a ride! – Thanks you very much but I should be fine…” I finally came to his place near Taihape, and discovered another lifestyle, again! I was back to the road next morning and arrived the afternoon in the Kaweka forest.

The route on the ridge was the most scenic I have ever made in the North Island, with a 360-degree lookout at 1720 m high. I used a cable way for the first time, and it was quite exciting! Then, in the Manson area, the ground was flat, with red sand and rocks as light and fragile as sponges. Mist might alter my eyes but the vegetation looked completely different to the typical New Zealand bush, small bulbs of red, green and gray seeds reminded me the Tongariro Circuit. Huts of this forest park are my favourite ones: pretty, bright orange, tiny but bigger than a bivvy.

To sum up, I walked 6 days and 6 nights in the Kaweka, 95 km long so 15.9 km per day. Then I hadn’t waited long to be picked up by a log truck driver. We went to Wairoa, the last town before Te Urewera National Park.
