# Jurmo

My midsummer weekend was in Jurmo, the southernmost place accessible by public transport in Finland. The landscape is not so different from the northernmost place in Finland that I visited [last winter](story:Hostile_Heaven). Wildlife is quite different though, the season and latitude certainly helps. I found many birds and bees, and spotted a grass snake.

This island is infamous for storms, a good location for trying my packraft for the first time in open water. I discovered the challenge to paddle against the wind, through waves. Packrafting was fun and motivating. Large rivers and lakes are fences to hikers. Having the possibility to cross them is opening many more opportunities to access remote wilderness.
