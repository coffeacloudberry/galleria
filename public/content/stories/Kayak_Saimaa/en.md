# Kayak in Saimaa

Saimaa is a large lake with many islands to explore. We joined a two-day course to learn the basics of kayaking, including paddling in the marsh, falling into cold water and getting back on board. We tried out kayaks of different shapes and features. We got sunburnt on the first day and we had patchy rain on the second day. We had so much fun that we rented a double kayak for an extra day. Steering with pedals on the feet required focus to be accurate while paddling. It was a full-body workout. In a country with thousands of lakes, kayaking is a way to go further!
