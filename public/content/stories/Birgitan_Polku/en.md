# Birgita Track

I am always surprised how close the forest is from the city and easy access by public transport (bus and tram). A friend and I walked the Birgitan Polku, a weekend track around Tampere, Finland. We pitched our tent next to a lake. Less natural but equally nice, we stopped halfway for ice cream. For this trip, we focused on telephotography, birds watching and zoomed landscape.
