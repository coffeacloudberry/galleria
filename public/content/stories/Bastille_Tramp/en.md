# Bastille Tramp

A local friend advised me a few scenic spots in the Mercantour National Park, France. The tricky game was to connect the dots, because the path from one spot to the next one isn't specified on the map. In other words, some sections are off-track. Going off the beaten track is not part of the French culture, French like clear tracks with signs and hotels. I've learnt {tramping}="hiking" in New Zealand and continued hiking in France the Kiwi way. That time, I had three days thanks to the Bastille Day.

I had {fine spells}="Moslty sunny" the first day, so I could walk off-track on steep dry scree. The view was stunning with magnetic cliffs: attractive and repulsive at the same time. I passed many pretty lakes, but the fog overwhelmed the mountain. I had {scattered rain}="Occurring or distributed over widely spaced and irregular intervals in time" and evening storms for the next two days. I chose to continue in Italy along a marked track which I couldn't go in a short weekend trip. Navigating through fog was mostly with my GPS, but I forgot my detailed Italian map, so my route was rather dull. That trip is definitely my favourite one in the region with a diverse environment and weather conditions. I recorded my longest hiking day ever: 14 hours and 41 minutes, from sunrise to dusk, with several photography breaks.
