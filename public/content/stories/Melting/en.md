# Melting

The transition from winter to spring is powerful. The snow melts one snowflake at a time. Plants emerge after months of dormancy. It is impressive how nature can change so dramatically in the exact same location, because the temperature has risen by just a few degrees. I hardly imagine what this place will look like after decades of climate crisis. I continue walking in the forest. Such a nature walk is a break from my consumerist life. Stop looking at your screen and go for a walk!
