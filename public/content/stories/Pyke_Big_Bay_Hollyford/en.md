# Pyke, Big Bay, Hollyford

My motivation broke down within a few hours whereas tramping the Hollyford Track. I had a heavy backpack loaded with a week of food. My feet hurt like never before, surprising after five months okay with my hiking boots – Lochnagar wasn’t that simple! I did not considered my adventure like holiday. I had neither job, nor home. I was a lone traveler. The feeling of transition is always a stressful period. I remembered Lake Kiriopukae and pushed myself beyond all that. The best representation of my mind in the bush would be a Mobiüs swingbridge with primitive thoughts on one side – physical state – and high humankind motivations on the other side – ambition, dreams, wisdom. I fought trees by hands, bushwalking along Lake Alabaster and Lake Wilmot. It was a navigation game to the Spyke crossing, and a kid game to Big Bay. I made the mistake not to use my gaiters on the beach and my bloody feet were painful due to scratching sand in my boots. I enjoyed the terrain diversity though – rocky beach, sand, forest, lakes and sea. I finished the circuit in 6.5 days and 7 nights.
