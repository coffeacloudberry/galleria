# Black Waterfalls Valley

When it comes to nature, the wilder the better. When it comes to society, the more connected the better. Social networks tend to connect with people of the same social bubble. On the other hand, I've been in a few bubbles while hitchhiking to the Guillaume village: I met a nurse, a couple of friends going to party, four polish dudes, a local beekeeper.

The diversity on the road reflected the diversity on the path. I started in the forest. The rain was rather heavy, and the lightning was more stressful than exciting – ~3 seconds between the flash and the thunder (1 km). As usual in the area, that didn't last, and I kept going up to 2,232 m high, where I enjoyed a peaceful sunset. The Barlatte valley is made of bright black rock and green grass with countless waterfalls.

I woke up with a blue sky, 5°C in my tent quickly warmed up by the first sunlight, and my porridge topped up with raspberry jam (made by the beekeeper). Then I hiked on scree and patches of snow on the Boulière saddle (2,629 m), walked down to the Estrop lakes, the forest, and a flat in Estenc completely covered of flowers.
