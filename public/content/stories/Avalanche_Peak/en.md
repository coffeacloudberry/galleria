# Avalanche Peak

I hitched to Castle Hill – a famous place for climbing boulders – with my sign “Please!” I stopped to the Arthur's Pass Village for a day walk: the Avalanche Track followed by the Scott's Track. Everything was peaceful and I talked to myself as I do from times to times when I feel lonely and 100% sure to be alone – so I do not look stupid talking to myself. A hiker came downhill, talking to himself too. He said he enjoyed his ramble, by being alone with nature. I finished the walk and got a ride the next morning. I really enjoyed nattering all the lift long, especially when feeling lonely and tired. We talked about gluten, music, the Lord of the Rings, New Zealand, etc. Even though Lord of the Rings was not really my inspiration to visit the country, I listened to the soundtrack a lot during the writing of my stories, my favourite peaceful ambient song.
