# Merveilles

A very scenic walk from Boréon to Fontan. Tracks are everywhere with some busy huts like in the Pyrénées. I met a few trekkers on my way and asked myself why to run when there is no rush – like a snail in a poppy! I sometimes manage to walk a surprisingly long distance, but never run. For that hike, I arrived in Boréon late Friday afternoon, spotted some fireflies, and pitched my tent overnight. On Saturday, I started hiking before sunrise for a fresh start and photo opportunities. I stopped near Fontan to hitchhike on Sunday morning.
