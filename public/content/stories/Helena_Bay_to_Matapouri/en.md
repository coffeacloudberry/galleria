# Helena Bay to Matapouri

Decided to do the green section of Te Araroa, I've selected some wilderness sections beforehand. This one was marked and I had good weather. However, I didn't know that yellow or blue markers are for the Department of Conservation only. Also, I missed a critical turning of the track halfway through. I was actually more focused on the good-looking Fly Agaric mushrooms than the plastic markers. I tried to know where I was heading, and it did not make any sense according to my map and compass. So I walked back to the last marker and found the actual turning. I made it!
