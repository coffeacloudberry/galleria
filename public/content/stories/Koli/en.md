# Hiking Koli in Autumn

Lapland became my usual destination for both summer and winter trips. But a friend of mine proposed to visit eastern Finland, and I did not hesitate. We have been hiking in Koli National Park. As usual, we used public transport from home to the forest. We arrived in the afternoon, hiked the hill to enjoy the sunset with a 360 panorama, and continued overnight until we could find a nice place to camp. The temperature was falling in late autumn. The ground started to be hard but soft enough to pitch the winter tent. Lakes started to freeze. The good thing when it is getting cold is that it does not rain. On the other hand, using the touchscreen of my camera is not so pleasant. However, autumn is full of opportunities, the forest is still green and the ice, snow, and crystals are adding nice effects and mood to photos. We planned to catch the bus, but we managed to hitchhike.
