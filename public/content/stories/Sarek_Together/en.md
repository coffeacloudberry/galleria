# Sarek Together

*Day 1:* My friend and I hitchhiked from Gällivare to Suorva, stopping to enjoy a lunch and take some photos next to the Stora Sjöfallet, a wide waterfall. From Suorva, we crossed the dam and followed a track through the dense forest. Once we got above the tree line, we went off-track and camped.

*Day 2:* We passed through all kind of plants, berries, bush, and swamps, down to Guordesluoppal, which we tried to cross. The water was freezing cold, so we had to turn back. We attempted the crossing in the wrong place. It wasn't the widest, deepest, or most flowing, but definitely the coldest.

*Day 3:* It was a really scenic day, and the weather was beautiful. We went through more bush, swamp, partial tracks, and easily crossed the streams between Bielajávrátja and Bierikjávrre. There wasn't a lot of water, but plenty of wet sand. It felt like stepping on corn starch. As you can see in the photos, we had a very reddish sunset.

*Day 4:* Sarek is a popular place. I've never seen so many hikers outside marked tracks, even though there are lots of swamps and rocks. We had yet another beautiful day with blue sky.

*Day 5:* We have been bush bashing through dense vegetation and steeply walking on rocks to get to the top. We were rewarded with a nice waterfall and view of the lake and mountain. Once we got to the top, we could see the flat, never-ending land. It was interesting to see so many mountains that were sharp on one side and smooth on the other.

*Day 6:* It was an easy walk on grass. The view was similar to Finland's. We reached the Skierffe summit (1179 m). It was a breeze, and the view of the valley was stunning. We kept going down to the river, passing through the moderately vegetated forest composed of birch, ferns, berries, and plenty of other native plants. We had a warm summer day, and we enjoyed the fall colours and a fresh mushroom soup for dinner.

*Day 7:* There was a blink-and-you-miss-it track: hard to find, easy to loose. We had stream crossings, swamps, and bush with light rain, so we ended up all wet. There aren't a lot of good campsites in the area, and we didn't check much beforehand. It wouldn't be much of an adventure if everything was known.

*Day 8:* We continued along the small track, through swamps, ups and downs, stream crossings. I was feeling exhausted in the afternoon, but I felt a lot better after a small snack. Two snacks a day is maybe better from performance point of view. It makes the backpack heavier, but you get more energy to keep going.

*Day 9:* I have never been so lucky with the weather. It was a really nice day, and the track was easy to follow. I was lucky that my friend were patient enough. I took many photos.

*Day 10:* We hiked along the same track that we used on our third day with a little detour to get a closer look at Lietit-Jaure. The entry of that lake looks easier to cross compared to the exit.

*Day 11:* Summer was over, there were fewer colours and more rain. We camped right by the dam and hitchhiked back to Gällivare the next morning, where we enjoyed the fresh local food we missed so much.
