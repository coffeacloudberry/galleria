# Snowy Ruskadventure 

I started crossing Ounasjärvi with my 1 kg inflatable packraft. I made the paddle with my trekking poles and duct tape to avoid carrying the paddle poles – too heavy. I had no safety jacket – too heavy – but the Ounas river was calm. I considered using the water taxi as too easy, and decided to paddle – for about 750 m. Probably nothing impressive for you, but a test against my fear of water for me! You know from my previous stories and experience that I am not a fan of water, but you can't only do things you are comfortable with, right?

Passed that river, the track was easy going, the weather was perfect. Some snow fell in the last days – while I was [hiking in the Pulju Wilderness Area](story:Ruskadventure). The colourful autumn foliage and snowy hills made a fantastic opportunity for photography and a rich walk from moss to snow.
