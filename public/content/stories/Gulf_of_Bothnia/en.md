# Hiking The Gulf of Bothnia

My plan was a 2-day hiking trip in the forest. I was walking out of the city when I crossed a bridge and spotted a dozen ducks on a stream. Then, while walking on a snow covered sandy beach, I realised how much frozen was the sea, so I just walked on it and headed straight to the bay of islands. That was my first steps on sea ice. I went as far as I could go, and stopped on an island where the ice faces the waves. I camped on the island and spent my first night with my new tent. A tunnel tent must be pitched properly to stand up and the snow on the island was much better for my pegs than thick ice. Walking on ice is like walking along the road, not soft at all, not nice for my hips. The landscape was flat yet diverse in shapes and imperfections. Contemporary art enthusiasts would enjoy the Mother Nature's piece of art. I feel like the sunniest weathers are the coldest. I had blue sky and a temperature from -13 to -23 Â°C. Thanks to my good clothing and sleeping bag, I was pretty warm, unless when I had to remove my mittens for taking pictures or blowing my nose, something I stopped the second day, and I had a proper stalactite under my nose at lunchtime.
