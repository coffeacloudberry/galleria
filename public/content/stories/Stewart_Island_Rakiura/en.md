# Stewart Island / Rakiura

I packed all my tramping gear and flew to Queenstown with an ATR72 and hitchhiked to Bluff for the Ferry after a short walk on the Millenium / Foveaux Walkway and a break in the Lighthouse Gallery & Cafe, 30 Gore St. That place is more than a nice coffee shop, it’s a great show room of pictures and art crafts. Arrived in Stewart Island / Rakiura, I had a coffee with a girl I met in the ferry and started alone my tramp toward Bungaree Hut.

I made a detour along the coast and spotted a couple of kākāriki but I didn’t make it to the hut, it got dark and I lost track. I bushwalked an hour overnight up to the beach and pitched my tent. I spent no more than five minutes next morning to find the track. Finally arrived in the hut, I realised I forgot my trekking pole and I walked back. However, it was high tide and I could not access my camping spot anymore. I lost my brand new pole at the first day! Fortunately, I hadn’t been flooded yet. Finally in the hut, I met Anton. I didn't know him before but we stayed together all the way. Thus the personal goal became a team work and “I” became “we”.

We climbed Hurunui, 2 km elevation up and down from Christmas Village Hut. The 360°-view on top was stunning. We could see the massive mountains of Fiordland and the nothingness of the far south with a blue sky all day. While a Fantail flying around you means bad luck in the Māori culture, those birds actually do that to catch the insects you move. Despite being my favourite bird, Anton and I were more amazed by the Brown Kiwis we spotted later on. Those flightless birds are shy and could only be found in remote wilderness requiring a few days walk, patience, and luckiness.

I caught a Spotted Wrase (aka Spotty) from the Freds Camp Hut’s wharf. It’s a small fish with not enough meat for two, and hard to catch. I boiled it and added some tikka masala. Anton baked fresh bread with his oil and flour we found in the hut. It was great having fresh food after days with dehydrated stuff.

We had good weather most of the time. Some sections of the southern part were seriously muddy and others were so swampy that we could not go straight, zigzagging like insects.

The Rakiura circuit was my longest tramp ever, 14 days and nights. Anton was a young friendly tramper super motivated and motivating. Fitter than me, he was super fast going up hill and I was faster going down. We pushed each other everyday. I guess we were stronger together.

I flied back to Invercargill and realised that a scenic flight does not make much sense. Whereas an overview of the landscape can be seen, most details are missed: no birds, no insects, no animals, no leaves. Warm rocks, trees, moss cannot be touched. Birds songs, wild animal calls, leaves through the wind, breaking ice cannot be heard. Crushed leaves cannot be smelt. Manuka tea cannot be tasted. A scenic flight is all about enjoying the view in the less eco-friendly way.

Notice that I write both the British and the Māori name (f.i. Stewart Island / Rakiura, Egmont / Taranaki) in respect to Māori. Indeed “as part of the Rangitane Tu Mai Ra (Wairarapa Tamaki nui-a-Rua) Treaty of Waitangi Settlement, a number of popular tramping destinations have had their original Māori names restored.” Source: FMC bulletin 210, Nov. 2017.
